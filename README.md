This small project is helping me learn HTML using The Odin Project. The goal of this small project is to recreate the Google.com homepage! 


Notes:
    - Started with setting up the HTML file and setting up the title on the page
    - Added the Google logo in the middle of the page (5/28/21)
    - Had trouble with styling the search bar, which I styled to my liking but having trouble with top border being a darker color than the bottom
