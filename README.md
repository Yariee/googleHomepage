This small project is helping me learn HTML using The Odin Project. The goal of this small project is to recreate the Google.com homepage! Due to working on a 27 inch external monitor,
the live demo may appear shifted on different screen sizes. I added some elements that may help minimize that but that will be for a later date, for now I will also add a screen shot
of the working live demo as I see it!
